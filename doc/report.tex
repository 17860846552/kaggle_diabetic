\begin{abstract}
We use convolutional neural networks trained with lasagne\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne}} and nolearn\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dnouri/nolearn}} with large color images, data augmentation, dynamic resampling for class imbalance and a ``per patient'' feature blending strategy which takes advantage of pairs of sample images for each patient. The final solution is a simple average of blends with features from two deep convolutional networks with different kernel sizes and three sets of weights for each network.
\end{abstract}

\section{Features Selection / Extraction}
The images in this competition are too large to be conveniently trained with convolutional networks and the hardware at our disposal. We crop away all background and resize the images to squares of 128, 256 and 512 pixels. Other than that we don't apply any preprocessing.

\subsection{Resampling}
The classes in the dataset are highly imbalanced. We found the following resampling strategy to work well in practice. Initially we sample from all classes such that all classes are represented equally on average. We then gradually oversample the rare classes less strongly. Mathematically if ${\bf w_0}$ are the initial resampling weights and ${\bf w_f}$ are the final resampling weights. The resampling weights at epoch $t$ are given by
\begin{equation}
{\bf w}_i = r^{t-1} {\bf w}_0 + (1 - r^{t-1}) {\bf w}_f
\end{equation}
where we set $r=0.975$, ${\bf w}_0 \approx (1.36, 14.4, 6.64, 40.2, 49.6)$ and ${\bf w}_f = (1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$ which were values we found to work well for initial convergence and final score. It's likely similar or better results could be achieved by using a dynamically weighted objective function but being very unfamiliar with the theano library we abandoned that approach we decided to opt for resampling instead as it was straight forward to implement.
\subsection{Initialization and Pretraining of smaller architectures}
We didn't succeed in training the large convolutional networks from scratch. Instead we first trained smaller networks on 128 pixel images, then used the trained weights to (partially) initialize networks of intermediate size which were trained on 256 pixel images. Finally we repeated this procedure for the final networks that were trained on 512 pixel images. We used orthogonal\footnote{https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne/blob/master/lasagne/init.py\#L329-L359} initialization for weights and constant initialization for biases.
\subsection{Data Augmentation}
We applied translation, stretching, rotation, flipping as well as color augmentation at all times. We also scaled and centered each image channel (RGB) to have zero mean and unit variance over the training set.

The output sizes for the data augmentation pipeline were 112/224/448 pixel for the 128/256/512 pixel input images. 
\subsection{Feature Extraction}
We extracted features from the last pooling layer of the convolutional networks. To increase the quality of the extracted features we repeated the feature extraction up to 50 times (with different augmentations) per image and used the mean features as well as the standard deviation of each feature for blending.
\subsection{Per Patient Blend}
For each eye the mean and standard deviation features of the eye were concatenated with the mean and standard deviation of the patients' other eye as well as an indicator variable to distinguish left and right eye. These features were then fed into a small fully connected two layer network. Here we used L1 and L2 regularization as well as a different empirical resampling strategy to cope with the class imbalance.


We extracted mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) of the RMSPool layer for 50 pseudo random augmentations for three sets of weights (best validation score,
best kappa, final weights) for net A and B.

For each eye (or patient) used the following as input features for
blending,

\[
{\bf x} = (\mu_\textrm{this eye}, \mu_\textrm{other eye}, \sigma_\textrm{this eye}, \sigma_\textrm{other eye}, \delta_\textrm{right})
\]

where $\delta_\textrm{right} \in \{0, 1\}$ is in an indicator variable for right eyes. We standardized all features to have zero mean and unit variance and use them to train a network of shape,

\begin{verbatim}
    Input        8193
    Dense          32
    Maxout         16
    Dense          32

\section{Additional Comments and Observations}
The data set for this competition is special in that the images contain important features such as Micro-aneurysms which are very small with respect to the size of the retina. We've learned that it's important for performance to use rather large input images to train the convolutional networks. The convolutional neural networks achieved quadratic weighted kappa scores of 0.70 for 256 pixel images and 0.80 for 512 pixel images on the validation set. We also tried 768 pixel images and this further increased kappa to 0.81. At this point the data augmentation became computationally very demanding and as we didn't see a significant improvement after blending per patient features from the 768 pixel images over the 512 pixel images we stuck with the latter.

It is considerably easier to train the large convolutional networks when the leaky rate of leaky rectifiers is increased. However we also found that for a given network architecture the performance of the leaky rectifiers network (with leaky rate 0.01 and trained with the strategy mentioned above) is slightly higher than that for very leaky rectifiers (with leaky rate 0.33, and trained from scratch). The difference is rather small but significant for competition results. After blending features for a single network the validation kappa would reach about 0.84 for leaky rectifiers and 0.83 for very leaky rectifiers. After switching from leaky to very leaky rectifier we spent about a month chasing down the origin of this 0.01 kappa gap, because the validation scores of the convolutional networks (before feature blending) were comparable for both types of rectifier units which lead us to believe we should have been getting the comparable kappa scores after blending.

\section{Simple Features and Methods}
Our final solution is an average of six per patient blends for the two convolutional network architectures and three different set of trained weights. Ensembling only increased the private leaderboard score from 0.84 to 0.845 and one would have to verify if this small performance increase justifies training a second network and extracting features six times as many augmentations of each input image.

We also noticed that blending the features for both patient eyes leads to significant performance improvements for various types of architectures. For this particular problem it provides a simple way to improve performance without having to redo or modify the feature extraction part of the pipeline.
